## Piebald v0.1.4 - file @-mentioning, rich text editor, agent skills

Today we're releasing Piebald v0.1.4, and we've got 3 significant features to share: **file @-mentioning**, a **rich text editor**, and support for [**agent skills**](https://agentskills.io/home).

## File @-Mentioning

Now you can mention files (and directories) in your chat to have them automatically read for the model, which can speed up the response time by eliminating round-trips to the inference provider and back.  Here's a screenshot:

## Rich-Text Editor

You can also now use a rich text editor to write messages, if you don't prefer using markdown:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="356" height="279" alt="Screenshot of" src="/imgs/v0-1-4/rich_text_editor.png"/>

It's disabled by default.  Enable it in **Settings → General → Rich-Text Editor.**  You can turn it on or off even with draft messages unsent&mdash;they'll automatically be converted to/from markdown.

## Agent Skills

We now support the new [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard.  Piebald will automatically discover global skills in `~/.claude/skills` and per-project skills in `./.claude/skills`.  We're supporting Claude Code's skill storage structure, being the most common, to make it easier to get started quickly; all of your existing skills should work in Piebald out of the box with no additional setup.  The default skills locations for other tools like Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode will be supported soon.

Here's a screenshot of skills working in Piebald:

## Other

We also added a little button on plans proposed by the AI that lets you copy the plan to your clipboard&mdash;useful to share or send to a new chat.  (Pro users only.)

## Next Up

We're working on **web search functionality**, powerful **branching** and **response rewriting** features, and support for logging in directly to provider subscriptions like **Claude Max**, **ChatGPT**, **Google AI**, and **GitHub Copilot**.  We're also going to be adding support for many **more providers** shortly.

<Update label="v0.1.3" description="December 22th, 2025">
  ## Piebald v0.1.3 - MCP server/tool enablement controls, chat status in the sidebar

In **v0.1.3** we added **controls to disable specific MCP servers/tools**, and made it much easier to **understand the state of chats from the sidebar:**

Now you'll see whether any chats are working, have finished working, or are waiting for tool call approval:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width={350} alt="A screenshot of the sidebar showing chats selected, working, finished, and waiting for a tool call approval." src="/imgs/v0-1-3/chat_status_sidebar.png"/>

And you can enable and disable specific MCP servers and individual tools.  Here's an example, where we have only `propose_plan_to_user` and `run_terminal_command` enabled, and those are the only ones the model gets:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width={600} alt="A screenshot of the chat config sidebar showing only two builtin tools selected." src="/imgs/v0-1-3/tool_enablement.png" />

We also added the ability to specify **custom instructions** when manually compaction a chat, we added the model's **currently active TODO** above the input box, and we added **GPT-5.2-Codex** and **Gemini 3 Flash** to our ChatGPT and Google AI subscription  support.

Lastly we fixed bugs in our Anthropic and OpenAI responses engines, a bug with reporting provider errors, and made the release notes dialog a bit bigger and scrollable.

**Next up:** We're working on file **@-mentions, branching, automatic chat tagging,** and **response rewriting,** among other things, and we'll be shipping more features in the next release!

<Update label="v0.1.2" description="December 17th, 2025">
  ## Piebald v0.1.2 - Token speed meter, repaired Windows support, bug fixes

  In this release we've fixed several bugs and introduced a small token speed meter that will show above the message input when a response is streaming.  It will show an estimated tokens-per-second speed an estimated total number of tokens generated for the current message:

  ![A screenshot of the new token speed and count meter.](/imgs/token_counter-v0-1-2.gif)

  The following bugs are now fixed:
  - **File editing on Windows:** On Windows, when the model tried to edit a file, it would fail if the file used Windows CRLF line endings (`\r\n`).  Now we detect the line endings of the file before applying the edit, normalizing the file to the most common line ending in case there are multiple in the same file
  - **Terminal commands on Windows:**  Few commands, even properly formatted ones, would successfully execute on Windows because we weren't handling escape characters correctly.  Now all valid Batch and PowerShell commands will run.  The default shell is currently command prompt (`cmd.exe`); this will be configurable in the future.
  - **Streaming:** A small streaming bug sometimes caused individual characters to be omitted&mdash;e.g., you might see `Hi! 👋 Im` instead of `Hi! 👋 I'm`.
  - **Google tool calls:** Tool calls were being incorrectly translated into Google's native format, causing an error.
  - **Importing credentials from Claude Code on macOS:** On Windows and Linux, Claude Code stores its OAuth credentials in `~/.claude/credentials.json`, but on macOS they're stored in the Keychain&mdash;now we correctly read from the Keychain on macOS when importing existing OAuth crendentials from Claude Code (it will require your password).  Thank you to [Chris Watson](https://github.com/watzon) for [reporting](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/piebald/issues/1)!

<Update label="v0.1.1" description="December 16th, 2025">
  ## Piebald v0.1.1 - Context Compaction, Plan Mode, Auto-scroll

  - **Context compaction:** If enabled, conversations will now be automatically compacted when 85% of the context is used (configurable).  You can also manually compact conversations via the "..." icon in the chat top bar.  The system prompt and hyperparameters for compaction can be modified via the "Context Compaction" system profile.
  - **Plan mode:** You can now switch any chat at any time into plan mode via shift+tab, exactly like Claude Code.  The builtin tool is called `ProposePlanToUser`, which we think is a more intuitive name than CC's `ExitPlanMode` tool.
  - **Auto-scroll:** Chats now auto-scroll down as messages are added to them.
  - **GPT-5.2:** GPT-5.2 is now in the list of ChatGPT-subscription-compatible models.
  - **Trash all chats:** There's a new button to trash (soft-delete) all the chats in a folder—useful if you have a bunch of test chats or an obsolete project.
  - **Hard-breaks:**  Multiple consecutive lines with no backslash or space after them and no empty line between them (aka hard-broken lines) are now displayed as separate lines instead of automatically being displayed as a single line.  Since this is somewhat uncommon (e.g. GitHub READMEs don't do this, though GitHub issue/PR comments do), we'll make this configurable soon, when we add markdown customization settings.

  **Up next:** Improved Windows support, file @-mentioning, streaming speed visualizer, and better sidebar chat metadata.
