<Update label="v0.1.6" description="January 1st, 2026">
## Piebald v0.1.6 - chat tags, continuation, web fetch

In this release we added `web_fetch`, two new Pro features, and a number of bug fixes.

## Automatic Chat Tagging (Pro)

You can now create **custom tags** ("labels" in GitHub/GitLab lingo) to assign to chats, and the automatic title generation process will also **automatically suggest** existing tags, and if configured, **new tags** for chats:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="900" alt="Screenshot of an new AI-proposed 'language-comparison' tag" src="/imgs/v0-1-6/new_tag_proposed.png" />

Having tags on chats requires Piebald Pro.

## Continuation (Pro)

There's now a **continue** button next to the **send** button in the bottom-right corner of the input box.  It's the equivalent of sending a "continue" message to the model, but instead of adding a dummy message, it just re-sends the current chat history to the provider exactly as is.  It's useful for when you accidentally interrupt the AI, or it returns a response but forgets to call tools:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="500" alt="Screenshot of Continue button in a chat with a user message but no AI message." src="/imgs/v0-1-6/continue_button.png" />

Continuation requires Piebald Pro.

## `web_fetch` builtin tool

We added a `web_fetch` builtin tool&mdash;a supplement to the `web_search` tool we added in v0.1.5&mdash;so that the model can directly read URLs.

## Other

We also removed the `builtin-agentic-tools__` prefix for builtin tools, so smaller models like Haiku 4.5 will hallucinate them much less frequently, and fewer tokens will be used.

And finally, we fixed bugs around error handling, editing, pasting text, cancelling, chat status, tool call output truncation, keyboard shortcuts, and scrolling.

## Next up

We're working on chat pausing/duplication/relocation, branching, response rewriting, context editing, direct OAuth login to Claude/ChatGPT/Google AI subscription, and Git worktree support.

<Update label="v0.1.5" description="December 29th, 2025">
## Piebald v0.1.5 - web search, HTTP traffic retention, log file

This release we've introduced a `web_search` tool, date-/count-based HTTP traffic log retention, a log file for debugging Piebald errors, and several smaller features and improvements.

## Web search

We've implemented a tool for the model to use to search the web, `web_search`.  We'll also be releasing a `web_fetch` tool in the next version.

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="400" alt="Screenshot of a web search for 'latest version of Node.js' being performed by Claude Haiku 4.5 in response to the user's query 'What is the latest version of Node.js?'" src="/imgs/v0-1-5/web_search.png" />

## HTTP traffic retention (Pro)

With Piebald Pro, you can record all of the HTTP traffic performed by Piebald when interfacing with AI provider APIs to inspect their contents, investigate context issues, and learn about how the provider APIs work.

The logs are very verbose, however, and can pile up quickly if you use Piebald heavily, so we added a feature where you can configure a maximum number of logs to retain and a maximum age.  For example, you can set the count to 5 to only keep the last 5 logs, and the date to 1 to only keep recent logs.

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="600" alt="Screenshot of the 'HTTP Traffic' section in the Piebald settings" src="/imgs/v0-1-5/http_traffic_settings.png" />

## "Draft prompt partially written" (Pro)

There's a new status displayed in the sidebar for sessions that have a draft prompt written up but not sent yet.  It displays as pink with the text "Draft prompt partially written:"

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="400" alt="Screenshot of the sidebar with several chats, one of them having the status 'Draft prompt partially written' as described" src="/imgs/v0-1-5/draft_prompt_partially_written.png" />

This feature is available on the Piebald Pro plan.

## Log File

We now write logs to a file named after the current date, e.g. `2025-12-29.log`, and they're located in Piebald's app data directory, which differs by platform:
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/piebald/logs`
- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\piebald\logs`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/piebald/logs`

## Other

We've added several smaller features as well:

- The `read_file` tool, when called with a path to a directory instead of a file, now lists the directory's contents instead of throwing an error.  We've observed Claude Haiku 4.5 frequently trying to do this.
- Hidden files are now shown in the file @-mentioning dropdown.  We also plan to make this configurable.
- Images displayed in the release notes viewer are now slightly rounded on the corners.
- The app now automatically checks for updates every 3 hours.

Plus **16** bug fixes and optimizations.

## Next up

We're working on web fetch, automatic chat tagging, branching, response rewriting, logging in to provider subscriptions, and worktree/Git integration, and we hope to have some of these major features out this week!

<Update label="v0.1.4" description="December 26th, 2025">
## Piebald v0.1.4 - file @-mentioning, rich text editor, agent skills

Today we're releasing Piebald v0.1.4, and we've got 3 significant features to share: **file @-mentioning**, a **rich text editor**, and support for [**agent skills**](https://agentskills.io/home).

## File @-Mentioning

Now you can mention files (and directories) in your chat to have them automatically read for the model, which can speed up the response time by eliminating round-trips to the inference provider and back.  Here's a screenshot:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="532" alt="Image" src="/imgs/v0-1-4/file_mentioning.png"/>

## Rich-Text Editor

You can also now use a rich text editor to write messages, if you don't prefer using markdown:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="356" alt="Screenshot of" src="/imgs/v0-1-4/rich_text_editor.png"/>

It's disabled by default.  Enable it in **Settings → General → Rich-Text Editor.**  You can turn it on or off even with draft messages unsent&mdash;they'll automatically be converted to/from markdown.

## Agent Skills

We now support the new [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard.  Piebald will automatically discover global skills in `~/.claude/skills` and per-project skills in `./.claude/skills`.  We're supporting Claude Code's skill storage structure, being the most common, to make it easier to get started quickly; all of your existing skills should work in Piebald out of the box with no additional setup.  The default skills locations for other tools like Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode will be supported soon.

Here's a screenshot of skills working in Piebald:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="552" alt="Image" src="/imgs/v0-1-4/agent_skills.png"/>

## Other

We also added a little button on plans proposed by the AI that lets you copy the plan to your clipboard&mdash;useful to share or send to a new chat.  (Pro users only.)

## Next Up

We're working on **web search functionality**, powerful **branching** and **response rewriting** features, and support for logging in directly to provider subscriptions like **Claude Max**, **ChatGPT**, **Google AI**, and **GitHub Copilot**.  We're also going to be adding support for many **more providers** shortly.
</Update>

<Update label="v0.1.3" description="December 22nd, 2025">
  ## Piebald v0.1.3 - MCP server/tool enablement controls, chat status in the sidebar

In **v0.1.3** we added **controls to disable specific MCP servers/tools**, and made it much easier to **understand the state of chats from the sidebar:**

Now you'll see whether any chats are working, have finished working, or are waiting for tool call approval:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width={350} alt="A screenshot of the sidebar showing chats selected, working, finished, and waiting for a tool call approval." src="/imgs/v0-1-3/chat_status_sidebar.png"/>

And you can enable and disable specific MCP servers and individual tools.  Here's an example, where we have only `propose_plan_to_user` and `run_terminal_command` enabled, and those are the only ones the model gets:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width={600} alt="A screenshot of the chat config sidebar showing only two builtin tools selected." src="/imgs/v0-1-3/tool_enablement.png" />

We also added the ability to specify **custom instructions** when manually compaction a chat, we added the model's **currently active TODO** above the input box, and we added **GPT-5.2-Codex** and **Gemini 3 Flash** to our ChatGPT and Google AI subscription  support.

Lastly we fixed bugs in our Anthropic and OpenAI responses engines, a bug with reporting provider errors, and made the release notes dialog a bit bigger and scrollable.

**Next up:** We're working on file **@-mentions, branching, automatic chat tagging,** and **response rewriting,** among other things, and we'll be shipping more features in the next release!

<Update label="v0.1.2" description="December 17th, 2025">
  ## Piebald v0.1.2 - Token speed meter, repaired Windows support, bug fixes

  In this release we've fixed several bugs and introduced a small token speed meter that will show above the message input when a response is streaming.  It will show an estimated tokens-per-second speed an estimated total number of tokens generated for the current message:

  ![A screenshot of the new token speed and count meter.](/imgs/token_counter-v0-1-2.gif)

  The following bugs are now fixed:
  - **File editing on Windows:** On Windows, when the model tried to edit a file, it would fail if the file used Windows CRLF line endings (`\r\n`).  Now we detect the line endings of the file before applying the edit, normalizing the file to the most common line ending in case there are multiple in the same file
  - **Terminal commands on Windows:**  Few commands, even properly formatted ones, would successfully execute on Windows because we weren't handling escape characters correctly.  Now all valid Batch and PowerShell commands will run.  The default shell is currently command prompt (`cmd.exe`); this will be configurable in the future.
  - **Streaming:** A small streaming bug sometimes caused individual characters to be omitted&mdash;e.g., you might see `Hi! 👋 Im` instead of `Hi! 👋 I'm`.
  - **Google tool calls:** Tool calls were being incorrectly translated into Google's native format, causing an error.
  - **Importing credentials from Claude Code on macOS:** On Windows and Linux, Claude Code stores its OAuth credentials in `~/.claude/credentials.json`, but on macOS they're stored in the Keychain&mdash;now we correctly read from the Keychain on macOS when importing existing OAuth crendentials from Claude Code (it will require your password).  Thank you to [Chris Watson](https://github.com/watzon) for [reporting](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/piebald/issues/1)!

</Update>

<Update label="v0.1.1" description="December 16th, 2025">
  ## Piebald v0.1.1 - Context Compaction, Plan Mode, Auto-scroll

  - **Context compaction:** If enabled, conversations will now be automatically compacted when 85% of the context is used (configurable).  You can also manually compact conversations via the "..." icon in the chat top bar.  The system prompt and hyperparameters for compaction can be modified via the "Context Compaction" system profile.
  - **Plan mode:** You can now switch any chat at any time into plan mode via shift+tab, exactly like Claude Code.  The builtin tool is called `ProposePlanToUser`, which we think is a more intuitive name than CC's `ExitPlanMode` tool.
  - **Auto-scroll:** Chats now auto-scroll down as messages are added to them.
  - **GPT-5.2:** GPT-5.2 is now in the list of ChatGPT-subscription-compatible models.
  - **Trash all chats:** There's a new button to trash (soft-delete) all the chats in a folder—useful if you have a bunch of test chats or an obsolete project.
  - **Hard-breaks:**  Multiple consecutive lines with no backslash or space after them and no empty line between them (aka hard-broken lines) are now displayed as separate lines instead of automatically being displayed as a single line.  Since this is somewhat uncommon (e.g. GitHub READMEs don't do this, though GitHub issue/PR comments do), we'll make this configurable soon, when we add markdown customization settings.

  **Up next:** Improved Windows support, file @-mentioning, streaming speed visualizer, and better sidebar chat metadata.
