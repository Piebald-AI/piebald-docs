  ## Piebald v0.1.2 - Token speed meter, repaired Windows support, bug fixes

  In this release we've fixed several bugs and introduced a small token speed meter that will show above the message input when a response is streaming.  It will show an estimated tokens-per-second speed an estimated total number of tokens generated for the current message:

  The following bugs are now fixed:
  - **File editing on Windows:** On Windows, when the model tried to edit a file, it would fail if the file used Windows CRLF line endings (`\r\n`).  Now we detect the line endings of the file before applying the edit, normalizing the file to the most common line ending in case there are multiple in the same file
  - **Terminal commands on Windows:**  Few commands, even properly formatted ones, would successfully execute on Windows because we weren't handling escape characters correctly.  Now all valid Batch and PowerShell commands will run.  The default shell is currently command prompt (`cmd.exe`); this will be configurable in the future.
  - **Streaming:** A small streaming bug sometimes caused individual characters to be omitted&mdash;e.g., you might see `Hi! 👋 Im` instead of `Hi! 👋 I'm`.
  - **Google tool calls:** Tool calls were being incorrectly translated into Google's native format, causing an error.
  - **Importing credentials from Claude Code on macOS:** On Windows and Linux, Claude Code stores its OAuth credentials in `~/.claude/credentials.json`, but on macOS they're stored in the Keychain&mdash;now we correctly read from the Keychain on macOS when importing existing OAuth crendentials from Claude Code (it will require your password).  Thank you to [Chris Watson](https://github.com/watzon) for [reporting](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/piebald/issues/1)!

<Update label="v0.1.1" description="December 16th, 2025">
  ## Piebald v0.1.1 - Context Compaction, Plan Mode, Auto-scroll

  - **Context compaction:** If enabled, conversations will now be automatically compacted when 85% of the context is used (configurable).  You can also manually compact conversations via the "..." icon in the chat top bar.  The system prompt and hyperparameters for compaction can be modified via the "Context Compaction" system profile.
  - **Plan mode:** You can now switch any chat at any time into plan mode via shift+tab, exactly like Claude Code.  The builtin tool is called `ProposePlanToUser`, which we think is a more intuitive name than CC's `ExitPlanMode` tool.
  - **Auto-scroll:** Chats now auto-scroll down as messages are added to them.
  - **GPT-5.2:** GPT-5.2 is now in the list of ChatGPT-subscription-compatible models.
  - **Trash all chats:** There's a new button to trash (soft-delete) all the chats in a folder—useful if you have a bunch of test chats or an obsolete project.
  - **Hard-breaks:**  Multiple consecutive lines with no backslash or space after them and no empty line between them (aka hard-broken lines) are now displayed as separate lines instead of automatically being displayed as a single line.  Since this is somewhat uncommon (e.g. GitHub READMEs don't do this, though GitHub issue/PR comments do), we'll make this configurable soon, when we add markdown customization settings.

  **Up next:** Improved Windows support, file @-mentioning, streaming speed visualizer, and better sidebar chat metadata.
