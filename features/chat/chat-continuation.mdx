Sometimes a model will forget to call tools in its response.  It may also stop for other reasons such as rate limits or internal server errors.  You might also manually interrupt it for any number of reasons.

In order to continue the agentic loop again, traditionally you'd have to send a dummy message like "continue" to the model.  But that pollutes the context and might cause the model to produce different output than it would have originally.

Piebald allows you to **directly continue the conversation without adding a dummy message.**  Click the <Icon icon="fast-forward" /> (continue) button next to the <Icon icon="send" /> (send message) button in the bottom-right corner of the input box when you're in a chat:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="500" alt="Screenshot of Continue button in a chat with a user message but no AI message." src="/imgs/v0-1-6/continue_button.png" />

The agentic flow will be continued seamlessly.  From the model's perspective there will not have been an interruption, and it will generate a response as normal.

<Warning>
    If you click continue but the model is not in the middle of an agentic loop or has already responded without any tool calls, you may see an empty message generated when using Claude models.

    {/*You can configure continuation to ignore empty generated messages if you don't want this behavior.*/}
</Warning>
