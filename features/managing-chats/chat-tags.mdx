If you have a lot of chats, it can be helpful to assign tags to them.  You can filter chats by their assigned tags, and they can tell you at a glance what areas a particular chat are about.

Tags are created in **Settings &rarr; Chat Tags.**  Chat tags require [Piebald Pro](https://piebald.ai/pricing).

## Automatically creating tags

Tags can be automatically assigned to a new chat by an AI when it generates a title for it.  The system prompt for the **Title & Tag Generation** built-in profile must include instructions to generate tags.  By default it does; if it doesn't, click "Reset to Default" to reset it to a default system prompt that includes the instructions.

Here's a screenshot of the title/tag generations model suggesting a new tag:

/>

Automatic existing tag assignment and new tag suggestion are enabled by default; go to **Settings &rarr; Title & Tag Generation** and turn off **Enable automatic chat tagging** or **Allow LLM to suggest creating new tags** to disable them.


## Filtering chats by tag

If you have tags created and assigned to chats, you can filter chats by tags.  Click the <Icon icon="funnel"/> icon in the top-right corner of the chat sidebar and select the tag or tags to filter by:

## Manually tagging a chat

If you'd like to manually assign a tag to a chat, click on the <Icon icon="ellipsis" /> icon on a chat in the sidebar and choose **<Icon icon="tag"/> Tag**.  There must be some tags created in the settings beforehand.

Then select one or more tags from the dialog and click **Save Tags.**
