<FreeBadge />

When the model is finished with a task or calls a tool that needs your attention, Piebald can display notifications on your desktop and play sounds with them.

Desktop notifications are enabled by default.  If you'd like to disable them, go to the **Settings &rarr; Notifications** and uncheck **Enable Desktop Notifications**.

## When notifications are sent

Piebald will send notifications for the events:
- The model finishes its task or response (technically, its generation completes without tool calls)
- The model calls one or more tools that require manual approval
- The generation fails due to a connection or server error (Pro)

It will only notify you for chats that you're not actively viewing, or if you're not in the app at all.  It won't notify you for the current chat.

## Customizing notification string format (Pro)

<ProBadge />

If you have [Piebald Pro](https://piebald.ai/pricing), You can customize the title and body that are used for notifications.  The default title and body for each notification type are as follows:

_Completion_

> **✓ \{\{chat_title\}\}** \
> Complete after \{\{duration\}\}

_Tool Approval_

> **⏸ \{\{chat_title\}\}** \
> \{\{tool_name\}\} awaiting approval

_Error_

> **✗ \{\{chat_title\}\}** \
> Error: \{\{error_message\}\}

The following variables are available to use in titles and bodies:
- `{{chat_title}}` - Chat title
- `{{duration}}` - Generation time (completion only)
- `{{tool_name}}` - Tool name (tool approval only)
- `{{tool_count}}` - Number of tools (tool approval only)
- `{{error_message}}` - Error details (error only)

## Sounds

Piebald can play a sound when it sends notifications, with a configurable volume level independent from the system volume level.  If you'd like to disable sounds for notifications, toggle **Notification Sounds** in **Settings &rarr; Notifications**.
