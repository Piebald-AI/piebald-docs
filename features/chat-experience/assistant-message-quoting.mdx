Frequently you may want to quote one of the model's messages for further refinement or explanation.  In Piebald, instead of just copying the text that you want to quote, you can select the text and click the **Quote** button just below the message:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="500" alt="Screenshot of Quote dropdown button (appears on selection of assistant message text)" src="/imgs/quote_dropdown_button.png" />

And then Piebald will insert the message directly into the message input as a markdown blockquote:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="500" alt="Screenshot of Quote dropdown button (appears on selection of assistant message text)" src="/imgs/markdown_blockquote.png" />

Piebald also supports quoting text in plans proposed by the model.
