If you have [Piebald Pro](https://piebald.ai/pricing), then file or folder paths that the model references in its responses will be highlighted with a colored file-type-specific icon and made clickable.  Clicking on them will open the file or folder in the default app/file browser.  We're developing an integrated file browser and code editor into the app, so that clicking the file paths will open the file in the editor.

Hovering over a reference will load the file and show it with syntax highlighting, similar to file-@mentions:

<img
  class="shadow-md rounded-xl"
  width="600"
  alt="Image"
  src="/imgs/clickable_hover_with_icons.png"
/>
