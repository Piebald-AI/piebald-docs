If you have [Piebald Pro](https://piebald.ai/pricing), then file or folder paths that the model references in its responses will be highlighted and made clickable:

Clicking on them will open the file or folder in the default app/file browser.  We plan to integrate a file browser and code editor into the app, and clicking the file paths will open the file in the integrated editor.

Hovering over a reference will load the file and show it with syntax highlighting, similar to file-@mentions:
