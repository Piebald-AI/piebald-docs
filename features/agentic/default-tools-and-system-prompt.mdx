# Default System Prompt

Unlike most agentic development tools, Piebald does not currently have a default system prompt.  For the present, we find that many models work just fine without a system prompt.

When we implement emulation of other agentic development tools, you'll be able to use their system prompts, and we'll consider developing a system prompt of our own; however, a large system prompt will generally just waste token space for capable models like Claude and GPT-5.x that don't directly need one.

<Note>
    When you use OpenAI models via a ChatGPT Pro/Plus subscription, we do pass a large system prompt.  This is a hard requirement that OpenAI's server imposes as a requirement to use the ChatGPT subscription API.

    This system prompt is the exact same one that Codex uses when you use it with a ChatGPT subscription.

# Built-in Tools

Piebald provides a set of built-in tools that are available to all models.

- `ReadFile`: Reads a file from the file system.  Does not add line prefixes.  Auto-approved for file paths in the current project.
- `WriteFile`: Writes the given contents to a file on disk.  Overwrite existing files, if any.  Auto-approved in auto-accept edits mode for file paths in teh current project.
- `EditFile`: Replaces a given old string with a given new string.  Auto-approved in auto-accept edits mode for file paths in teh current project.
- `Glob`: Search for file paths via glob patterns, e.g. `**/*.ts`.
- `Grep`: Search for text in a folder recursively using regular expressions.  Accepts a variety of [ripgrep](http://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)-like options.
- `WebFetch`: Returns the text content of page at the given URL.
- `WebSearch`: Searches the web for the given query using [Exa.](http://exa.ai/)
- `RunTerminalCommand`: Runs the given terminal command.  Uses `sh` on macOS and Linux and `cmd /C` on Windows, but you can [configure the shell used for executing terminal commands.]()
- `TodoWrite`: Updates the current todo list for the chat.
