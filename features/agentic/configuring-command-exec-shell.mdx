When a model wants to execute a terminal command, it uses the built-in `RunTerminalCommand` tool (see [Default tools & system prompt](/features/default-tools-and-system-prompt)).  Internally, the `RunTerminalCommand` tool executes the given command using `sh -c` on UNIX systems (macOS and Linux) and `cmd.exe /C` on Windows.  However, you can change the default shell to a preset or a custom command.

Go to **Settings &rarr; Built-in Tools** and select a preset for **Terminal Shell.**  The default presets are:

**UNIX:**
- Bourne Shell (`/bin/sh`)
- Bash (`/bin/bash`)
- Zsh (`/bin/zsh`)

**Windows**
- Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
- Windows PowerShell
- Git Bash (MinGW)

Git for Windows must be installed in order to use Git Bash in Piebald.  Download it from [gitforwindows.org](https://gitforwindows.org/).

## Using a custom shell

You can also specify a custom shell, which is useful when you want to use a shell not explicitly mentioned above.  For example, if you have custom aliases in a shell like Fish.

To use a custom shell, set **Terminal Shell** to **Custom...** and then enter each individual argument required to invoke the shell with a command.  Most UNIX shells accept a `-c` argument, e.g. `fish -c "..."`.  Use `{command}` as the last argument.

<Warning>**Do not wrap the `{command}` argument in quotes** unless you're using a custom shell that requires it.  When you use a custom shell, Piebald passes each argument to the shell directly without needing to quote arguments.</Warning>

We plan to automatically detect installed shells so you won't have to go the custom route for the majority of cases.
