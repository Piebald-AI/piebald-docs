When the model proposes a plan, it can be convenient to copy the plan to your clipboard to paste into a new chat, share to a teammate, or save to a file.  With [Piebald Pro](https://piebald.ai/pricing), plans proposed by the AI have a copy button (<Icon icon="copy" />) that will copy the markdown contents of the plan to your clipboard:

<img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" alt="Screenshot of a plan with the copy button circled" src="/imgs/copying_plans.png" />

Copying plans requires [Piebald Pro](https://piebald.ai/pricing).
