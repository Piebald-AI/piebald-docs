Piebald's chat sidebar provides an easy way to understand the state of all of your chats.  There are several statuses that Piebald reports for chats:

- **Working:** When the model is generating a response or calling tools.
- **Finished:** When the model is finished working and the result is ready for you to take action.
- **Pending your approval:** When the model proposes a plan or called a tool that needs your approval/denial.

[Piebald Pro](https://piebald.ai/pricing) offers additional statuses to give further insight:

- **Draft prompt partially written:** When you've written a message in the chat but have not yet sent it.
- **Error during generation:** When an error occurs during a response generation (network errors, credit balance too low, invalid configuration, etc.)

Here's a screenshot of the various statuses in action:
