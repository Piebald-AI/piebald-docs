Welcome to Piebald!

[Piebald](https://piebald.ai) is a desktop\* app that makes it easier than ever to do agentic development, while at the same time giving you complete control over the configuration, context, and flow, all from a powerful desktop UI that runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

<sub>\*A local web version, similar to Jupyter Notebooks, is coming soon.</sub>

Piebald comes in two plans: **Basic** and **Pro.** Head over to our [pricing](https://piebald.ai/pricing) page for details.

4. **Open a folder**
5. **Give an order** or **ask a question** about your codebase

# Introduction

Piebald is an **agentic development tool**, also known as an AI coding agent. If you're familiar with Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex, or similar tools, you already know how to use Piebald.

To get started, open a folder in Piebald. A new chat will be created, and you can begin giving orders or asking questions just as you would with other tools.
