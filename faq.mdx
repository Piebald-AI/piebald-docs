## Why does it say that it's Claude Code?

> I'm using Claude Max and when I say "Hi" to Piebald, it says "I'm Claude Code" &mdash; why?

Anthropic requires that all requests to their Claude Pro-/Max-specific API begin with a special string that says

```
You are Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude.
```

Any request that does not have this line is rejected.  If you're using Piebald with your Claude Pro/Max subscription, we have to pass this string along, and so the model will think that it's Claude Code.

However, this does not affect the model's functionality.  It will perform great inside Piebald without knowing that it's not actually working inside Claude Code.
