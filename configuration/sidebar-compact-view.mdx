The chat sidebar in Piebald has a "Compact" view that hides most metadata about each chat, leaving only the status indicator and the title.  This allows the sidebar to display a denser chat listing.   You can click the <Icon icon="rows-4" />/<Icon icon="rows-2" /> icon to enable/disable the compact view.

Chats that are older than 3 days are also hidden by a banner that you can click to expand them all.  This threshold is configurable through **Settings &rarr; Appearance &rarr; General &rarr; Recent Chat Threshold** and is by default set to 3 days.
