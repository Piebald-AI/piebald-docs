Piebald generates a log file containing debugging information that you can use in an effort to understand bugs and unexpected behavior.

The log files are named after the current date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD.log`.  The folder in which they're generated varies by platform:
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/piebald/logs`
- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\piebald\logs`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/piebald/logs`
