## Piebald v0.1.6 - chat tags, continuation, web fetch

In this release we added `web_fetch`, two new Pro features, and a number of bug fixes.

## Automatic Chat Tagging (Pro)

You can now create **custom tags** ("labels" in GitHub/GitLab lingo) to assign to chats, and the automatic title generation process will also **automatically suggest** existing tags, and if configured, **new tags** for chats:

/>

Having tags on chats requires Piebald Pro.

## Continuation (Pro)

There's now a **continue** button next to the **send** button in the bottom-right corner of the input box. It's the equivalent of sending a "continue" message to the model, but instead of adding a dummy message, it just re-sends the current chat history to the provider exactly as is. It's useful for when you accidentally interrupt the AI, or it returns a response but forgets to call tools:

<img
  class="shadow-md rounded-xl"
  width="500"
  alt="Screenshot of Continue button in a chat with a user message but no AI message."
  src="/imgs/v0-1-6/continue_button.png"
/>

Continuation requires Piebald Pro.

## `web_fetch` builtin tool

We added a `web_fetch` builtin tool&mdash;a supplement to the `web_search` tool we added in v0.1.5&mdash;so that the model can directly read URLs.

## Other

We also removed the `builtin-agentic-tools__` prefix for builtin tools, so smaller models like Haiku 4.5 will hallucinate them much less frequently, and fewer tokens will be used.

And finally, we fixed bugs around error handling, editing, pasting text, cancelling, chat status, tool call output truncation, keyboard shortcuts, and scrolling.

## Next up

We're working on chat pausing/duplication/relocation, branching, response rewriting, context editing, direct OAuth login to Claude/ChatGPT/Google AI subscription, and Git worktree support.
