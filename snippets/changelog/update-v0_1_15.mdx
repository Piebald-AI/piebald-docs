## Piebald v0.1.15 - Bug fixes (new folder picker, search query with hyphens, update dialog)

In this release, we've fixed a few small bugs:

* In some scenarios (e.g. on macOS), the "Date Modified" column in the new folder picker wasn't wide enough for the date, causing the date in every row to wrap to another line.
* Fixed a small issue with searching when the search query contains hyphens (e.g. `hello-world`).
* Made the text in the "A new version is available" dialog smaller to allow more text to be displayed without scrolling.
