## Piebald v0.1.12 - portable Windows installation & direct sign-in to AI provider subscriptions

In Piebald v0.1.12 we've added portable distribution for Windows users and and direct sign-in to AI provider subscriptions.

## Direct sign-in to AI provider subscriptions

You can now sign-in to your Claude, ChatGPT, and Google AI subscriptions directly in Piebald without having to sign in Claude Code/Codex/Gemini CLI beforehand and import the credentials from them.  We're working on merging the option to import credentials from those tools into the direct sign in flow to save you a sign in if you already have valid credentials with those tools.

You can even sign in to multiple subscriptions from the same provider (e.g. multiple Claude.ai accounts with Claude Max) and use them independently!

## Portable Distribution

We now offer two methods of installation for Windows users: an installer and a **portable** ZIP file.  The ZIP file ([`piebald-portable-windows-x64.zip`](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/piebald/releases/latest/download/piebald-portable-windows-x64.zip)) contains `piebald.exe` ready to use.  Use the portable distribution if you can't or don't want to run the installer.

## Up next

Chat branching, context editing, live streaming of terminal command output, subagents, response rewriting, Git worktree support, web mode.
