## Piebald v0.1.20 - Image support, subagent model customization, monospace font customization

In this release we've added image support, raw markdown mode, monospace font customization, subagent model customization, and OAuth provider token editing!

## Image support

Piebald now has first class support for vision models that can take images as input, like Claude, GPT-5, and Gemini.  Image input is also supported when using Amazon Bedrock.  You can upload an image from disk via file picker, drag & drop an image from your desktop, or paste a screenshot from your clipboard.  The images will be queued and attached to your next message.

## Setting to customize the monospace font

In addition to the main app font, you can now customize the monospaced font used for inline code and code blocks, in **Settings &rarr; Appearance &rarr; Monospace Font Family**.

## Customizing the model and profile before approving subagents

When the model launches a subagent, you now have the option to change the model it uses before it starts:

## Raw markdown mode

Pro users can now turn on raw markdown mode, where messages' markdown content is displayed as plain text with syntax highlighting instead of being rendered as HTML:

## Edit OAuth providers' tokens

You can now view, and even edit, the OAuth access and refresh tokens for OAuth providers like Claude Max:
