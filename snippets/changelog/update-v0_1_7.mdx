## Piebald v0.1.7 - chat relocation & duplication

In v0.1.7 we added two features for chat management: **chat duplication & relocation**.

## Relocating chats (Pro)

Click the dropdown menu on chats in the sidebar and you'll be presented with a **Relocate** option.  It will open up a folder browser and after you select a new location, it will configure that chat to run tool calls in that directory.  It will also rewrite existing messages, tool call inputs/outputs, and context notifications to point to the new directory.

You can also relocate the chat via the config sidebar if you change the path manually:

Chat relocation requires [Piebald Pro.](https://piebald.ai/pricing)

## Duplicating chats (Pro)

In the same dropdown there's now a **Duplicate** option.  It'll duplicate the chat with all its messages and tool calls in the exact same state, as well as any draft prompt you're still writing, any tags you've assign it, and any custom config you've set on it.

## Other

A few other things:
- We added support for Claude Opus 4.5's **effort** parameter, which you can configure in the config sidebar under **Overrides → Anthropic Overrides.**
- We made HTTP traffic retention enabled by default, and existing users who have it disabled will get a notification on app startup if the app's data file is taking up >50 MB.
- We also enhanced the styling for thinking blocks:

| before | after |
| ------- | ----- |
| <img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="350" alt="Screenshot of the old thinking style." src="/imgs/v0-1-7/old_thinking_style.png" /> | <img class="shadow-md rounded-xl" width="400" alt="Screenshot of the new thinking style." src="/imgs/v0-1-7/new_thinking_style.png" /> |
