  ## Piebald v0.1.3 - MCP server/tool enablement controls, chat status in the sidebar

In **v0.1.3** we added **controls to disable specific MCP servers/tools**, and made it much easier to **understand the state of chats from the sidebar:**

Now you'll see whether any chats are working, have finished working, or are waiting for tool call approval:

And you can enable and disable specific MCP servers and individual tools.  Here's an example, where we have only `propose_plan_to_user` and `run_terminal_command` enabled, and those are the only ones the model gets:

We also added the ability to specify **custom instructions** when manually compaction a chat, we added the model's **currently active TODO** above the input box, and we added **GPT-5.2-Codex** and **Gemini 3 Flash** to our ChatGPT and Google AI subscription  support.

Lastly we fixed bugs in our Anthropic and OpenAI responses engines, a bug with reporting provider errors, and made the release notes dialog a bit bigger and scrollable.

**Next up:** We're working on file **@-mentions, branching, automatic chat tagging,** and **response rewriting,** among other things, and we'll be shipping more features in the next release!
