## Piebald v0.1.4 - file @-mentioning, rich text editor, agent skills

Today we're releasing Piebald v0.1.4, and we've got 3 significant features to share: **file @-mentioning**, a **rich text editor**, and support for [**agent skills**](https://agentskills.io/home).

## File @-Mentioning

Now you can mention files (and directories) in your chat to have them automatically read for the model, which can speed up the response time by eliminating round-trips to the inference provider and back. Here's a screenshot:

## Rich-Text Editor

You can also now use a rich text editor to write messages, if you don't prefer using markdown:

<img
  class="shadow-md rounded-xl"
  width="356"
  alt="Screenshot of"
  src="/imgs/v0-1-4/rich_text_editor.png"
/>

It's disabled by default. Enable it in **Settings → General → Rich-Text Editor.** You can turn it on or off even with draft messages unsent&mdash;they'll automatically be converted to/from markdown.

## Agent Skills

We now support the new [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard. Piebald will automatically discover global skills in `~/.claude/skills` and per-project skills in `./.claude/skills`. We're supporting Claude Code's skill storage structure, being the most common, to make it easier to get started quickly; all of your existing skills should work in Piebald out of the box with no additional setup. The default skills locations for other tools like Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode will be supported soon.

Here's a screenshot of skills working in Piebald:

## Other

We also added a little button on plans proposed by the AI that lets you copy the plan to your clipboard&mdash;useful to share or send to a new chat. (Pro users only.)

## Next Up

We're working on **web search functionality**, powerful **branching** and **response rewriting** features, and support for logging in directly to provider subscriptions like **Claude Max**, **ChatGPT**, **Google AI**, and **GitHub Copilot**. We're also going to be adding support for many **more providers** shortly.
