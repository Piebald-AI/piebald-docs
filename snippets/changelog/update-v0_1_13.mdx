## Piebald v0.1.13 - Branching

In this release we've introduced **chat branching**!

## Chat branching (Pro)

You can now conduct multiple sub-conversation/threads in the same chat with **chat branching**.  Also known as forking, chat branching allows you to fork/branch the conversation at any user or AI message at any point in the conversation.

You can branch by replying to a previous message, or by editing & regenerating an existing message. See [the docs for branching](https://docs.piebald.ai/features/chat-experience/branching) for more details.

## Quickly switch between rich text and markdown

We've added a little button to quickly switch between rich text and markdown.  This only applies for the current chat and is reset to your default setting in **Settings &rarr; General &rarr; Rich-Text Editor**.

You can disable the button via **Settings &rarr; General &rarr; Show Rich Text Mode Switcher**.

## Other

We've also fixed several significant bugs pertaining to tool call approval and chat history disappearing, Gemini Code Assist caching, markdown parsing, streaming, the `AskUserQuestion` tool, and payment handling.
