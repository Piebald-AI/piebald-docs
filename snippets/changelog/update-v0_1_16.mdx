<Update label="v0.1.16" description="February 5th, 2026">
## Piebald v0.1.16 - Redesigned message action buttons & Claude Opus 4.6

We've redesigned message action buttons (Copy, Edit, Delete, etc.) and added support for Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT 5.3 Codex.

## Redesigned message action buttons

Previously, message action buttons (Copy, Edit, Delete, etc.) were large and hard to see against the messages background, and when the viewport was shrunk they could sometimes disrupt the UI.  Now they take up much less space and float over message bounding boxes.  We also added a hover background to improve the contrast between messages.

## Claude Opus 4.6

We also added complete support for Claude Opus 4.6 and its new adaptive thinking/max thinking effort settings.

## New Claude/ChatGPT subscription models will be available instantly from now on

Up till now, the list of models that you could use with Claude and ChatGPT subscriptions had to be hard-coded in the app.  However, recently there are new APIs available that return the list of models usable with those subscriptions.  This means that you'll be able to use the latest Anthropic and OpenIA models with your subscriptions as soon as they're released, instead of waiting for us to release a new update.
