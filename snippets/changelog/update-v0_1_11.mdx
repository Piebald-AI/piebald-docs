## Piebald v0.1.11 - desktop notifications & Amazon Bedrock

In this release, per user requests, we've added desktop notifications with sounds and support for Amazon Bedrock.

## Desktop notifications

Whenever the model finishes generation or calls a tool that blocks while it's waiting for your approval, you can now get notified immediately via desktop notifications on macOS, Windows, and Linux.  A sound can also be played with the notification, and clicking on the notification will bring you right into the specific chat.  Additionally, if you're on the Pro plan, you can choose from 30+ extra sounds.

## Amazon Bedrock

You can now use all text-based models available via Amazon Bedrock (Claude, Nova, OSS models, etc.) in Piebald.  You can source credentials from the environment (env vars, profile, shared creds, EC2 role, SSO), or manually input an access key ID and a secret access key.

Different models require different configuration, so check out [the docs for our Amazon Bedrock integation](https://docs.piebald.ai/providers/amazon-bedrock) for more information.
